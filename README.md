## Run Locally

1. Run `colab/ParametricCurve_Fit.ipynb` on Google Colab **or**
   execute `code/fit_curve.py` locally after installing dependencies (`numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`)(basic imports).
2. Generated figures and results are saved in the `figures/` folder.
3. The verified final parameter values are reported above and detailed in `report.pdf`.
